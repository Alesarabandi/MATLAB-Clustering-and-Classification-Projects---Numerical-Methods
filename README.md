This repository showcases MATLAB-based projects focusing on custom implementations of clustering and classification algorithms for various datasets. Each project combines rigorous mathematical methodologies with comprehensive MATLAB coding to address real-world classification challenges, covering techniques such as K-means, K-medoids, and clustering evaluations. **You can find the full description on the pdf file.**

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

1. **Iris Dataset Clustering with K-means and K-medoids**
   - **Objective**: Classify the well-known Iris dataset into three species using custom implementations of K-means and K-medoids algorithms.
   - **Methodology**: The K-means and K-medoids algorithms were implemented from scratch. K-means minimizes within-cluster variance, while K-medoids (using the L1 distance) reduces sensitivity to outliers by choosing actual data points as medoids.

2. **Breast Cancer Biopsy Data Analysis with K-medoids**
   - **Objective**: Cluster biopsy data to distinguish between benign and malignant samples, focusing on maximizing accuracy and robustness.
   - **Methodology**: Missing data entries are handled, and K-medoids clustering is employed, using sensitivity and specificity metrics to assess the methodâ€™s effectiveness in identifying malignant cases.

</p>

   - **Evaluation**: Sensitivity and specificity scores reveal the clustering accuracy, making it a practical diagnostic tool. The algorithm is tested across multiple runs to ensure robust results.
3. **1984 Congressional Voting Records Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Investigate partisan voting behavior in the 1984 U.S. Congress by clustering representatives based on their voting patterns.
   - **Methodology**: A dissimilarity matrix was computed using a custom dissimilarity index for "yes"/"no" votes, while managing missing votes by assigning a neutral score. K-medoids clustering is then applied to group representatives by voting alignment.
   - **Evaluation**: Confusion matrices reveal a clear partisan split, showing the effectiveness of K-medoids in political data clustering. Additional analysis assesses the voting consistency within each cluster.

4. **Wine Classification Using Chemical Properties**
   - **Objective**: Classify Italian wines from three cultivars based on 13 chemical attributes, comparing the performance of K-means and K-medoids algorithms.
   - **Methodology**: Both K-means and K-medoids algorithms are applied to the wine dataset, with clusters evaluated for accuracy against the true wine cultivars.

5. **Cardiac SPECT Data Clustering for Patient Classification**
   - **Objective**: Classify cardiac patients as normal or abnormal using binary data from SPECT images.
   - **Methodology**: Dissimilarity matrices are created using binary metrics, followed by K-medoids clustering to separate patients based on diagnostic markers.
   - **Evaluation**: Confusion matrices and a custom 2x2 classification matrix evaluate the clustering accuracy, reflecting how well attributes correspond to patient health status.
